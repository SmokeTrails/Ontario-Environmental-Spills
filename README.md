# Analyzing Environmental Spills in Ontario Project

This project is currently **in progress**.

In this project, I used a dataset that contains information related to environmental spills in Ontario between 2003 and 2020 to answer the following research question:

What were the major sources, causes and consequences of environmental spills in Ontario between 2003
and 2020, and how did the number, sources, causes and consequences of environmental spills change across
different years and locations?

Thus far, I have used the `tidyverse` and `ggplot` packages in the R programming languages to wrangle the data and create a variety of visualizations, which has helped me get a good idea of the answer to my question. I have written a report presenting my findings thus far, which can be found on this repo.

As part of my next steps, I will use Machine Learning to help predict various characteristics of environmental spills. Specifically, I am looking to use techniques like bagging, random forests, decision trees, and boosting to gain further insight into the data.
